playground for node backend applications

the goal is to prepare several different simple showcases for node.js based backend frameworks such as Express.js, Fastify, Meteor.js, Koa.js, Hapi.js, Feathers.js and NestJS (using both Express.js and Fastify).

These frameworks are to be compared in terms of the following criterea:

1. Performance (Speed, Scalability)
2. Ease of Use (Learning Curve, Syntax and Design)
3. Flexibility (Extensibility, Modularity)
4. Community and Ecosystem (Community Syze, Ecosystem)
5. Documentation and Support (Quality of Documentation, Support Options)
6. Feature Set (Built-in Features, Compliance and Security)
7. TypeScript Support (Type Definitions, Development Experience)
8. Development and Deployment (Development Tools, Deployment Options)
9. Use Cases and Suitability (Target Applications, Case Studies and References)
10. Licensing and Cost (License, Cost)
